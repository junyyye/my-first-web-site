  The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) is a worldwide information space where people can share information through computers connected to the Internet . Often referred to simply as the Web . The term is often used synonymously with the Internet, but strictly speaking they are different concepts. The Web is just one service that runs on the Internet, like e-mail .
