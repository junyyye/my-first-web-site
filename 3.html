<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
  The first birth started in 1995 when Brandon Eike , who was working at Netscape , designed it in 10 days. At first, it was called Mocha, but after 4 months, it was renamed LiveScript, and after 3 months it was renamed to JavaScript, which continues to this day. The superficial reason is that it was named JavaScript because its syntax is similar to Java, but it was intentionally named that way to take advantage of Java 's popularity .
